# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The ViciDial Exploit Suite is an ongoing research project. While active development may continue, we recommend using only the most recent version of the tool for testing purposes. Security updates will be provided for the latest version if any vulnerabilities are discovered within the tool itself.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.x.x | :x:                |

## Responsible Use

This tool is intended for **ethical hacking and security research** only. **Do not use this tool on systems for which you do not have explicit permission to perform testing.** Misuse of the ViciDial Exploit Suite can result in legal action, and the author is not responsible for any damage caused by improper or illegal use of this software. Always ensure you have proper authorization before running any security tools on live systems.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in the ViciDial Exploit Suite or its dependencies, please follow these steps to report it:

1. **Contact Us**: Send an email to [your-email@example.com] with details about the vulnerability. Please include:
   - A detailed description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.
   - Any relevant logs, screenshots, or proof-of-concept code.

2. **Response Time**: You can expect an initial response within **72 hours**. After we assess the report, we will provide you with an estimated timeframe for fixing the issue.

3. **Disclosure Policy**: We follow a responsible disclosure process. If a vulnerability is confirmed, we will work to resolve the issue privately before any public disclosure is made. We request that you do not publicly disclose any details of the vulnerability until we have released a fix or mitigated the issue.

4. **Recognition**: If you identify a legitimate vulnerability, we will acknowledge your contribution in the project’s release notes unless you wish to remain anonymous.

## Scope of Vulnerability Reporting

We encourage responsible reporting of security vulnerabilities in the following areas:
- The functionality of the ViciDial Exploit Suite itself.
- Any dependencies listed in the project’s `requirements.txt`.
- Potential misuse of the tool that could cause unintended damage or harm outside of the stated use case.

Please note that vulnerabilities in ViciDial itself should be reported to the maintainers of ViciDial and not this project. This tool is designed for research and testing purposes; it is your responsibility to ensure it is used ethically.

## Security Best Practices

To protect against vulnerabilities in your own environment:
- Always test in isolated and authorized environments.
- Ensure proper monitoring is in place when conducting security research.
- Regularly update your tools and dependencies to prevent known vulnerabilities from being exploited.
- Avoid running exploit tools on production environments without explicit permission and safeguards in place.
